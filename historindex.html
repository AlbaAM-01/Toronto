    <h2>Pre-19th century</h2>
    <p>The site of Toronto lay at the entrance to one of the oldest routes to the northwest, a route known and used by
        the Huron, Iroquois, and Ojibwe, and was of strategic importance from the beginning of Ontario's recorded
        history.<br>In the 1660s, the Iroquois established two villages within what is today Toronto,
        <em>Ganatsekwyagon</em> on the banks of the Rouge River and Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. By 1701,
        the Mississaugas had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver Wars, with
        most returning to their homeland in present-day New York.<br>French traders founded <em>Fort Rouillé</em> in
        1750 , but abandoned it in 1759 during the Seven Years' War. The British defeated the French and their
        indigenous allies in the war, and the area became part of the British colony of Quebec in 1763.<br>During the
        <em>American Revolutionary War</em>, an influx of British settlers came here as United Empire Loyalists fled for
        the British-controlled lands north of Lake Ontario. The Crown granted them land to compensate for their losses
        in the Thirteen Colonies. In 1787, the British <em>Lord Dorchester</em> arranged for the Toronto Purchase with
        the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, thereby securing more than a quarter of a million acres of land
        in the Toronto area. The first 25 years after the Toronto purchase was quiet, although "there were occasional
        independent fur traders" present in the area, with the usual complaints of debauchery and drunkenness.<br>

    In 1793, Governor <em>John Graves Simcoe</em> established the town of York on the Toronto Purchase lands, naming
    it after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Simcoe decided to move the Upper Canada capital from Newark
    to York, believing the new site would be less vulnerable to attack by the United States. The <em>York
        garrison</em> was built at the entrance of the town's natural harbour, sheltered by a long sand-bar
    peninsula. The town's settlement formed at the harbour's eastern end behind the peninsula, near the present-day
    intersection of Parliament Street and Front Street .

    <h2>19th century</h2>
    <p>In 1813, as part of the <em>War of 1812</em>, the <em>Battle of York</em> ended in the town's capture and plunder
        by United States forces. John Strachan negotiated the town's surrender. American soldiers destroyed much of the
        garrison and set fire to the parliament buildings during their five-day occupation. Because of the sacking of
        York, British troops retaliated later in the war with the burning of Washington, D.C.<br>
        York was incorporated as the City of Toronto on March 6, 1834. Reformist politician <em>William Lyon
            Mackenzie</em> became the first mayor of Toronto and led the unsuccessful <em>Upper Canada Rebellion</em> of
        1837 against the British colonial government.<br>As a major destination for immigrants to Canada, the city grew
        rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century. The first significant wave of immigrants were Irish, fleeing
        the Great Irish Famine; most of them were Catholic. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest
        single ethnic group in the city. The Scottish and English population welcomed smaller numbers of Protestant
        Irish immigrants, some from what is now Northern Ireland, which gave the <em>Orange Order</em> significant and
        long-lasting influence over Toronto society.<br>
        For brief periods, Toronto was twice the capital of the united <em>Province of Canada</em>: first from 1849 to
        1852, following unrest in Montreal, and later 1856–1858. After this date, Quebec was designated as the capital
        until 1866 . Since then, the capital of Canada has remained Ottawa, Ontario.Long before the Royal Military
        College of Canada was established in 1876, supporters of the concept proposed military colleges in Canada.

    Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a three-month-long military course at the School of
    Military Instruction in Toronto. Established by Militia General Order in 1864, the school enabled officers of
    militia or candidates for commission or promotion in the Militia to learn military duties, drill and discipline,
    to command a company at Battalion Drill, to drill a company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a company,
    and the duties of a company's officer.<br>

    <h2>20th century</h2>
    <p>The <em>Great Toronto Fire of 1904</em> destroyed a large section of downtown Toronto. The fire destroyed more
        than 100 buildings. The fire claimed one victim, John Croft, who was an explosive expert clearing the ruins from
        the fire. It caused CA$10,387,000 in damage.<br>The city received new European immigrant groups beginning in the
        late 19th century into the early 20th century, particularly Germans, French, Italians, and Jews. They were soon
        followed by Russians, Poles, and other Eastern European nations, in addition to the Chinese entering from the
        West. As the Irish before them, many of these migrants lived in overcrowded shanty-type slums, such as <em>"the
            Ward,"</em> which was centred on Bay Street, now the heart of the country's Financial District.<br>
        In 1954, the City of Toronto and 12 surrounding municipalities were federated into a regional government known
        as Metropolitan Toronto. The postwar boom had resulted in rapid suburban development and it was believed a
        coordinated land-use strategy and shared services would provide greater efficiency for the region. The
        metropolitan government began to manage services that crossed municipal boundaries, including highways, police
        services, water and public transit.<br>

    In the decades after World War II, refugees from war-torn Europe and
    Chinese job-seekers arrived, as well as construction labourers, particularly from Italy and Portugal. Toronto's
    population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale suburbanization began and doubled to two
    million by 1971. Following the elimination of racially based immigration policies by the late 1960s, Toronto
    became a destination for immigrants from all parts of the world. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as
    Canada's most populous city and chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty
    raised by the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement, many national and multinational corporations moved
    their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and <em>Western Canadian cities</em>.</p>

    <h2>21st century</h2>
    <p>The city attracted international attention in 2003 when it became the centre of a major SARS outbreak. Public
        health attempts to prevent the disease from spreading elsewhere temporarily dampened the local economy. From
        August 14–17, 2003, the city was hit by a massive blackout which affected millions of Torontonians (it also
        affected most of Southern Ontario and parts of the United States), stranding some hundreds of people in tall
        buildings, knocking out traffic lights and suspending subway and streetcar service across the city during those
        aforementioned days.<br>The city continues to grow and attract immigrants. A 2019 study by <em>Toronto
            Metropolitan University</em> showed that Toronto was the fastest-growing city in North America. The city
        added 77,435 people between July 2017 and July 2018. The Toronto metropolitan area was the
        second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in North America, adding 125,298 persons, compared with 131,767 in the
        Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metroplex in Texas. The large growth in the Toronto metropolitan area is attributed
        to international migration to Toronto.</p>
