                <p>The memorial park was twice threatened to be removed. During the planning stages of the<em>Gardiner
                        Expressway</em> , it was proposed to move <em>Old Fort York</em> to Coronation Park. This was
                    opposed by
                    a coalition of veteran's groups and historical societies.A second occurred in 1971 when it was
                    proposed to
                    expand <em>Exhibition Place</em>, turning the park into a new location for the midway amusements and
                    rides.
                    Veterans' and labour organizations successfully stopped the proposal.
                    <br>

                    The memorial was rededicated on
                    November 10, 2018 on the 100th-year anniversary of the end of World War I.It was rededicated by
                    <em>Ontario
                        Lieutenant-Governor Elizabeth Dowdeswell</em>, Toronto Mayor John Tory and members of
                    the<em>Canadian
                        Armed Forces</em> . The memorial is being restored during 2018 and 2019 using funds from a
                    Government of
                    Canada program to refurbish cenotaphs and memorials country-wide, the City of Toronto and private
                    sources.

                        Street West</em>.
                    Designed by sculptor <em>Emanuel Hahn</em>, the monument was the first place entry in a design
                    competition
                    for a
                    memorial to commemorate Adam Beck. It was unveiled in 1934.

                <p>Adam Beck, respected for his efforts in developing the province of Ontario's hydroelectricity
                    generation
                    and
                    transmission infrastructure and in bringing hydroelectricity into public hands, died in 1925. Four
                    years
                    later, a committee was appointed by <em>Toronto City Council</em> to determine how best to
                    commemorate
                    his
                    life, venerated as Ontario's greatest public servant at the time.[2] It recommended a bronze statue
                    on
                    University Avenue, and a design competition was initiated with a call for designs on 29 April
                    1929.<br><em>Emanuel Hahn</em> won the competition, while Alfred Howell and G.A. Bachman placed
                    second
                    and
                    third, respectively. The statue was originally to be located in front of the 1915 Hydro-Electric
                    Power
                    Commission of Ontario Buildingbut this plan proved to be impractical because it would interfere with
                    access
                    to Toronto General Hospital across University Avenue. Hahn rejected the suggestion of Queen's Park
                    as a
                    possible site and after working with him to find an agreeable location, Toronto City Council
                    approved
                    the
                    site in the University Avenue median just south of Queen Street in February 1932.In spite of not
                    being
                    located in front of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario office building on University
                    Avenue,
                    the
                    sculpture was oriented northward towards it as a symbolic link, and also to the Ontario Legislative
                    Building, where Adam Beck had served as a Member of Provincial Parliament.

                <p>The <strong>Princes´Gates</strong> is a triumphal arch and a monumental gateway at Exhibition Place
                    in
                    <em>Toronto</em>,<em>Ontario</em>, Canada. Made out of cement and stone, the triumphal arch is
                    flanked
                    by
                    colonnades on both of its sides, with curved pylons at both ends. The structure serves as the
                    eastern
                    gateway to the Canadian National Exhibition, an annual agricultural and provincial fair held at
                    Exhibition
                    Place.<br>The Princes' Gates was initially conceived in the 1920s, forming part of a larger
                    redevelopment
                    effort of the eastern portions of Exhibition Place. Work began on Princes' Gates in April 1927, and
                    was
                    completed several months later in August.

                <p>The <em>Canadian National Exhibition</em> (CNE) was established in 1879 at the foot of Dufferin
                    Street,
                    leasing the western-most portion of the Military Reserve attached to the Toronto Garrison. Over
                    time,
                    the
                    CNE expanded eastward and took over more of the Reserve. By the 1920s, it was now looking to expand
                    to
                    the
                    easternmost section of the Reserve site at the foot of Strachan Avenue.In 1924, the Chapman and
                    Oxley
                    architectural firm was contracted to make a 50-year development plan for the eastern portions of the
                    Exhibition Grounds, including the Princes´Gates.Princes' Gates was initially intended to serve as
                    the
                    main
                    entrance to a walled park.<br>Inspiration for the design of Princes' Gates came from other British
                    and
                    French triumphal arches that Chapman visited while visiting western Europe for the 1925 British
                    Empire
                    Exhibition.[3] Although plans for Princes' Gates were conceived in the early 1920s construction of
                    the
                    structure did not take place until 1927.Construction for the triumphal arches took place later that
                    year,
                    from April 14 to August 30, with the structure itself costing approximate <em>CA$152,240</em>.</p>
