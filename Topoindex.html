                <p>The <em>name of Toronto</em> has a history distinct from that of the city itself. Originally, the
                    term "Taronto"
                    referred to a channel of water between <em>Lake Simcoe</em> and <em>Lake Couchiching</em> on maps as
                    early as
                    1675 but in time the name passed southward, and was eventually applied to a new fort at the mouth of
                    the Humber
                    River. Fort Toronto was the first European settlement in the area, and lent its name to what became
                    the city of
                    Toronto.<br></p>

                John Graves Simcoe identified the area as a strategic location to base a new capital for Upper Canada,
                believing Newark to be susceptible to American invasion. A garrison was established at Garrison Creek,
                on the western entrance to the docks of Toronto Harbour, in 1793; this later became Fort York. The
                settlement it defended was renamed York on August 26, 1793, as Simcoe favoured English names over those
                of First Nations languages, in honour of Prince Frederick, Duke of York.Residents petitioned to
                change the name back to Toronto, and in 1834 the city was incorporated with its original name
